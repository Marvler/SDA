Presentation regarding parcels was already performed so I will write scenarios according to packages functionalities.

1. Type name of the package
2. Type name of the package
3. Type name of the package
4. Type Recipient Parcel locker ID (asd34 i.e.)
5. Type sender Parcel locker ID (afd91 i.e.)
6. Choose status. Depending on your choice, package will be assigned to recipient parcel locker, sender, or none of them.
   Let's say it is in Not Sent status.

Type "2" and then "3" to display all parcel lockers with packages. Due to fact that new package was in NOT SENT status
it is asssigne to sender locker afd91.

You can also look at it by clikcin 3 in package menu, and typing afd91

In package menu type 4 to go in Updating package details functionality
1. Type id of package. You can copy id from sender locker afd91
2. Update package name.
3. Update package size.
4. Update package weight(double).
5. Update package recipient.
6. Update package sender.
7. Update sender locker ID (i.e. afd91)
8. Update recipient locker ID (i.e. afd93) 
9. Update status to DELIVERED

as status changed package move from sender locker parcel to recipient locker parcel
